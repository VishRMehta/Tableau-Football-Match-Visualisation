# Tableau-Football-Match-Visualisation

* Using Tableau, I set out creating a visualisation which simply conveys some key insights into the loss of Charlton F.C. against Reading F.C. Visualisations were created based on the data derived by a highlighted reel posted of the match.

## Analysis

1. **Path of Attacks:**

**Reading (Blue Team):**
Reading's attack patterns show a highly structured and coordinated approach. They utilized the width effectively, with attacks originating from their defensive half and progressing through wide channels. This width allowed Reading to stretch Charlton's defense and exploit spaces centrally, creating high-quality chances in the final third.

**Charlton (Orange Team):**
Charlton's attack seems more direct and centrally focused. The shorter passing sequences and a lack of width indicate that the team struggled to break down Reading’s defense. While there was some penetration through the middle, Charlton couldn’t effectively stretch Reading’s backline or create sufficient space for higher-quality chances.

**Key Takeaway:**

Tactical Adjustment for Charlton: To counter teams like Reading in the future, Charlton needs to diversify their attacking play by incorporating more width and mixing up the routes of attack. Stretching the play with overlapping full-backs or wide wingers will help create gaps in Reading’s defense. A greater focus on switching play and varying between direct and indirect attacks could help Charlton be less predictable and more dangerous in possession.

2. **Passes Completed:**

**Reading (Blue Team):**
Reading’s passing network shows a dominance in both midfield and the final third, with frequent link-up play between their defense and attack. The concentration of passes in the attacking third demonstrates that Reading controlled the game’s tempo, particularly when transitioning into Charlton’s half.

Charlton managed a shot from outside Reading’s box, but it came from Reading’s left side (Charlton’s attacking right). This indicates that Charlton didn’t effectively penetrate the box, relying on long-range efforts instead of working the ball into more dangerous shooting positions.

Tactical Adjustment for Charlton: Charlton needs to tighten up defensively on their right side, as this is where Reading found the most success. Charlton’s right-back or right-center-back may need more support from the midfield to block channels that Reading exploited.

### Conclusion

**Charlton (Orange Team):**

Charlton’s completed passes are shown in Reading's half, but they are mostly concentrated around the left wing and center areas. There are fewer passes in Reading’s right flank, which suggests Charlton may not have used the full width of the field. Charlton dominated possession in Reading’s half but struggled to turn this into effective final-third entries, especially on the right.

Tactical Adjustment for Charlton: Although Charlton was able to dominate possession in Reading's half, they need to spread play more evenly across both flanks. Encouraging the right-sided attackers and full-backs to push forward and create overlapping runs would give Charlton more passing options and force Reading to stretch their defense. Better off-the-ball movement from attacking players will also open up space for through balls and combinations in central areas.
